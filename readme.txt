Mod名 朝野纷争
Mod版本 A.H.3
本mod专注于领地管理与个人生活。
机制改动：
<1>新增中央集权政体
独立的封建制领主到了游戏后期可以通过决议转化政体为集权制政体，集权制政体权力高度集中于最高领主。集权制领主可以通过罢免地方官的方式打击不守规矩的封臣。
<2>新增随机天灾事件
不同地形下的伯爵领会遭遇不同的自然灾害，洪水、火灾、地震还有干旱，作为领主，你必须表现出足够的责任心来赢得领地臣民的尊重。
<3>新增内政博弈系统
政治不只是打打杀杀，还有人情世故。与身居高位的同僚或是领主交好，可以给你带来意想不到的增益。而对于那些不怀好意地奸臣，你也应当具备以和平手段打击他们的能力。
<4>新增领地政策系统
领地政策包含兵役制度、内阁权力、提案权以及经济政策，不同级别的政策都有不同的加成与减成，需要玩家仔细斟酌取舍。领主与封臣都可以对领地内的政策施加影响。

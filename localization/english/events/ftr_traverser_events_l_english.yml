While I sighed, a man in gorgeous Greek clothing came to me. He called himself [constantine.GetShortUIName], and like me, he was a ruler of a country that had traveled from another world. Unlike me, this land is now his former land. He proposed to make a deal with me. I would lead troops to help him restore Constantinople, and he would help me achieve hegemony."
